# Demystifying Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, are a powerful tool for text processing and pattern matching. They allow you to define complex search patterns within strings, making them a fundamental skill for any programmer.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will explore a specific regex pattern that matches email addresses. We will break down each component of the regex, explain its functionality, and provide examples of how it works.

The regex pattern we'll be discussing is:


/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors, represented by ^ and $, define the start and end of a line in a regex pattern. They ensure that the entire string matches the pattern.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers, such as {1,3}, specify the number of times a character or group must appear in the string for a match. For example, a{3} matches "aaa."
### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs, denoted by parentheses (), allow you to group characters or subpatterns together. This helps in applying quantifiers and alternation to a group of characters.
### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, like [A-Za-z], match any single character within the defined set. They are useful for specifying character ranges.
### Character Classes
Character classes, such as \d for digits and \s for whitespace, are shorthand for commonly used sets of characters.
### The OR Operator
The | symbol is used for alternation. It allows you to match either one expression or another. For example, cat|dog matches "cat" or "dog."
### Flags
Flags, added after the closing delimiter of a regex pattern, modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include g for global and i for case-insensitive matching.
### Character Escapes
Character escapes, like \n for a newline and \t for a tab, represent special characters in regex patterns.
